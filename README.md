# Views_Of_Masculinity
In this project I used a K-Means Clustering Model to analyze survey data collected from FiveThirtyEight and WNYC Studios on their male readers thoughts on masculinity.

The code for this project can be found under Masculinity_Script.py in the Masculinity_Script folder. The PDF file in the same folder holds the questionare that the survey recipients filled out. The data from this survey is stored in masculinity.csv
